TextRPG
=======

This is a simple text based game. Feel free to use it if you want. Better documentation will be put up later once it is more developed.


<h3>End Goal</h3>
I plan on using SQLite3 to store items, jobs, monsters etc. for the game so that people can make games just by creating and modifying the database that the game reads from. This is what TextRPGCreator is eventually going to do. Everything is still in a rough testing state but feel free to send pull requests or help out. Also any criticism is appreciated!
